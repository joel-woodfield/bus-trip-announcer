# Bus Trip Announcer

## What is it?

**BusTripAnnouncer** is an app that tells you the next stops on the bus. The user can get this info by inputting their location, the bus number, and the headsign of the bus. It currently supports buses in South East Queensland, Australia.

## Why is this useful?

Most buses in South East Queensland do not announce the stops. If you do not know the location very well, you may have difficulty figuring out when to get off the bus.
**BusTripAnnouncer** makes this process easier.

## Example usage
In this imaginary trip, we will catch the route 66 bus from South Bank station to UQ Lakes station. For this demo, we will manually input the coordinates from random points on the route, as well as the current time. For the real mobile application, this will be done automatically using the phone's GPS (work in progress).

Note that UQ Lakes station is the last stop for this bus.
